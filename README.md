# Ender3V2-WHead
Mid low-cost Ender3V2 Direct Drive mod


Designed in shapr3d
# STATUS: Rough Draft
I will need to actually get parts to test fit first because my printer clearences are wonky and I don't have the time or money to get 100% acurate results.


The main benefits here are A. Direct drive, B. Dual fan cooling, and C. Controlled and directed part cooling airflow


_personal note:_ I need money to test fit, because I need a specific wrench, and some parts from the BOM.


# Parts list
the following materials are the basic components used for the mod


1. 2x 4010 12v Blower Fans(the flatter kind)
2. 1x 4010 24v Fan 
3. Dragonfly Phaetus BMS hotend
4. Dual gear extruder bits
5. 42-40 stepper motor
6. Screws(not able to specify yet)


_personal note:_ I am committed and already bought some parts on here, but I don't have the parts required for testing yet
